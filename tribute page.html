            <li><strong>July 5, 1989 Meets With the South African President</strong>

              <p>Mr. Mandela meets informally with Mr. Botha at the presidential office in Cape Town. It is the first publicly acknowledged meeting between Mr. Mandela and a government official outside prison, and leads to speculation that he will soon be released.</p>

            </li>
            <li><strong>Aug. 15, 1989 New President Pledges to Phase Out Apartheid</strong>

            </li>
            <li><strong>Oct. 15, 1989 Prominent Political Prisoners Released</strong>

              <p>The government frees eight of the country’s most prominent political prisoners, including Walter Sisulu, 77, a mentor to Mr. Mandela and his close friend, in a gesture that is widely seen as a trial run for Mr. Mandela’s release.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Feb. 2, 1990 Ban Lifted on A.N.C.; Mandela's Release Promised</strong>

              <p>Mr. de Klerk lifts the ban on the A.N.C. and several other political organizations, and lifts many of the restrictions put in place when the state of emergency was declared four years earlier. He promises that Mr. Mandela will be released shortly.</p>

              <p>A mob descends on the black township of Boipatong, killing more than 40 people with guns, knives and axes. The A.N.C. contends that Zulu men and white police officers were responsible for the violence.
